# JAVASCRIPT DESIGN PATTERNS

**Creational Patterns:**

- [Abstract Factory](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/abstract-factory-design-pattern): Creates an instance of several families of classes
- [Builder](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/builder-design-pattern): Separates object construction from its representation
- [Factory Method](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/factory-method-design-pattern): Creates an instance of several derived classes
- [Prototype](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/prototype-design-pattern): A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- [Singleton](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/singleton-design-pattern): A class of which only a single instance can exist

**Structural Patterns:**

- [Adapter](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/adapter-design-pattern): Match interfaces of different classes
- [Bridge](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/bridge-design-pattern): Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
- [Composite](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/composite-design-pattern): A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- [Decorator](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/decorator-design-pattern): Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- [Facade](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/facade-design-pattern): A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- [Flyweight](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/flyweight-design-pattern): A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- [Proxy](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/proxy-design-pattern): An object representing another object

**Behavioral Patterns:**

- [Chain of Responsibility](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern): A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- [Command](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/command-design-pattern): Encapsulate a command request as an object
- [Interpreter](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/interpreter-design-pattern): A way to include language elements in a program
- [Iterator](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/iterator-design-pattern): Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- [Mediator](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/mediator-design-pattern): Defines simplified communication between classes
- [Memento](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/memento-design-pattern): Capture and restore an object's internal state
- [Observer](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/observer-design-pattern): A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- [State](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/state-design-pattern): Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- [Strategy](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/strategy-design-pattern): Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- [Template Method](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/template-method-design-pattern): Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- [Visitor](http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/visitor-method-design-pattern): Defines a new operation to a class without change
