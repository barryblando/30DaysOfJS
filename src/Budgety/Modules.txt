 /**
  * Modules: {
      - Important aspect of any robust application's architecture
      - Keep the units of code for a project both cleanly separated and organized;
      - Encapsulate some data into privacy and expose other publicly
      - Break up our code into logical parts which are the modules and then make them interact with one another,
        inside of separate, independent, and organized units.
  }
  * TASK LIST [Planning Step 1]

    * UI MODULE [ VIEW ]: {
      TODO: Get Input Values
      TODO: Add the New Item to the UI
      TODO: Update the UI
    }

    * DATA MODULE [ MODEL ]: {
      TODO: Add the new Item to Our Data Structure
      TODO: Calculate Budget
    }

    //Control the Entire App and acting as a link
    * CONTROLLER MODULE [ CONTROLLER ]: {
      TODO: Add Event Handler
    }

    * Module Pattern: { Private and Public Data, Encapsulation and Separation of Concerns }
    * MP Secret is that it returns an object containing all of the functions that we want to be public to access.
    * Data Encapsulation allows us to hide the implementation details of a specific module from the outside scope so that we only expose a public interface which is sometimes called an API.
    * Separation of Concern is that each part of the application should only be interested in doing one thing independently

  * TASK LIST [Planning Step 2]

    * TODO: Add Event Handler
    * TODO: Delete the Item from our Data Structure
    * TODO: Delete the Item to the UI
    * TODO: Re-calulate budget
    * TODO: Update the UI

    * Event Delegation P.S Important part in JS when it comes manipulating DOM
      * Event Bubbling - When an event is fired or triggered will also be fired on all the parent elements
      * on at a time in a DOM tree until the HTML element which is the root and event that cause to happen is called
      * Target Element (e.g Button, etc) - this element is a property in the event object, this means that all the parent elements on which the event will also fire,
      * will know the target element of the element, which brings event bubbling to the Event Delegation in DOM tree
      * and if know where the event was fired you can simply attach an event handler to a parent element and wait for the event to bubble up,
      * and do whatever you intended to do with the target element.
      * Event Delegation - is to not set up the event handler on the original element that you're interested in,
      * but to attach it to a parent element, basically catch the event there because it bubbles up, and act on the element that you're interested in using the target element property.

      * Use Cases for Event Delegation
        - When you have an element with lots of child elements that you're interested in;
        - When you want an event handler attached to an element that is not yet in DOM when our page is loaded.
