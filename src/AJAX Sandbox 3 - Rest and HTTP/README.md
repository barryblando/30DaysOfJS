# REST APIs and HTTP

- **REST** - Representational State Transfer
  - Architecture style for designing networked applications
  - Relies on a stateless, client-server protocol, almost always HTTP
  - Treats server objects as resources that can be created, destroyed
  - Can be used by virtually any programming language
  - All APIs have their own rules and structure

- **HTTP** Request
  - GET: Retrieve data from a specified resource
  - POST: Submit data to be processed to a specified resource
  - PUT: Update a specified resource
  - DELETE: Delete a specified resource

  - HEAD: Same as GET but does not return a body
  - OPTIONS: Returns the supported HTTP methods
  - PATCH: Update partial resources

- **API Endpoints**
